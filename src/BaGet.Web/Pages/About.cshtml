    <h1>Reloaded II Community NuGet Repository</h1>
    <text>

        Powered using a custom version of BaGet ðŸ¥–.
    </text>

    <h1>Resources</h1>
    <text>
        This server is hosted by a single cheap VPS in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (Germany).<br/>
        There is no special Content Delivery Network (CDN) of any kind and storage is limited.<br/>
        There is no set upload limit, however please try to keep your packages to a maximum of 50MB.
    </text>

    <h1>Intended Use Cases</h1>
    <text>
        Resolving dependencies, i.e. downloading mods required by other mods.<br/>
        Especially with older mods where metadata to resolve dependencies isn't part of 'ModConfig.json'.<br/><br/>

        Using this service is not recommended for non-code mods, it is recommended to upload regular mods to <a href="https://gamebanana.com">GameBanana</a>.<br/>
        (Hint: NuGet doesn't support image previews or captions, for example.)

    <text>
        This repository is open to everyone, registration free.<br/>
        Anyone can freely download, upload and delete (their own) packages.<br/><br/>

    <h1>I am not a web developer</h1>
    <text>
        This website is a 'minimal effort' endeavour.<br/>
        That is to say, I just made it work for my needs and called it a day.
